**Once** there was a story. His name was *Zu*

```coffee
and he liked blue
```

```rb
he.said do
```

```py
eat(tofu) for tofu in tofus
```

```styl
b
  font-weight: 900000
```

```coffee
array1 = []
array1[0] = "Dillenidae"
array1[1] = "animus"
array1[2] = "Kona"
alert "Elements of array1: " + array1 # Dillenidae,animus,Kona
 
array2 = ["Cepphus", "excreta", "Gansu"]
console.log "Value of array2[1]: " + array2[1] # excreta
```

```python
array = []
 
array.append(1)
array.append(3)
 
array[0] = 2
 
print array[0]
```

```ruby
# create an array with one object in it
a = ['foo']
 
# the Array#new method allows several additional ways to create arrays
 
# push objects into the array
a << 1         # ["foo", 1]
a.push(3,4,5)  # ["foo", 1, 3, 4, 5]
 
# set the value at a specific index in the array
a[0] = 2       # [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
 
# a couple of ways to set a slice of the array
a[0,3] = 'bar'    # ["bar", 4, 5]
a[1..-1] = 'baz'  # ["bar", "baz"]
a[0] = nil        # [nil, "baz"]
a[0,1] = nil      # ["baz"]
 
# retrieve an element
puts a[0]
```
